# Chess Website in F# 
This repository contains the code for a website that allows the user to play chess over the board. 

The project is structured into three different modules: Core, Console and Web. The Core module contains main business logic, 
namely the chess game code as well as different serialisation utilities. The Web module contains the main web page which is 
written with the Elmish library, using the MVU pattern. The Console module can be used for using playing chess through a terminal.
